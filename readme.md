# Scaffoldrite: Define. Enforce. Generate.

> *Structure the right way*

**Stop guessing. Start structuring.**
Your project’s architecture should be as reliable as your code. Scaffoldrite makes it enforceable.

## 🚀 What is Scaffoldrite?

Scaffoldrite is a CLI tool that helps you:

* Define project structure in a single file (`structure.sr`)
* Enforce architecture rules with constraints
* Generate consistent project scaffolds
* Validate filesystem structure automatically

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Run instantly (recommended)

```bash id="8xq1p2"
npx scaffoldrite init
npx scaffoldrite generate .
```

---

### Or install globally

```bash id="k9d2lm"
npm install -g scaffoldrite
```

```bash id="p3xv8a"
sr init
sr generate .
```

---

## 📁 Core Idea

You define your project structure:

```sr id="structure_example"
folder src {
  folder components {
    file Button.tsx
  }
  file index.ts
}

constraints {
  mustContain src index.ts
}
```

Scaffoldrite ensures your filesystem matches this blueprint.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

* Declarative project structure (`structure.sr`)
* Enforceable constraints for architecture rules
* CLI-based workflow (init, generate, validate, update)
* Sync between filesystem and structure definition
* Template-friendly project generation

---

## 🛠 Common Commands

```bash id="cmds"
npx scaffoldrite init
npx scaffoldrite generate .
npx scaffoldrite validate
npx scaffoldrite update --from-fs .
npx scaffoldrite find Button
```

Or using global install:

```bash id="cmds_global"
sr init
sr generate .
sr validate
```
